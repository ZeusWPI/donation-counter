## How to

Dependencies are managed with poetry, it's pretty.
You can install poetry from pip by executing `pip install --user poetry`

If you want to, and I recommend this, create a virtual environment for the project.
```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Now install the dependencies with `poetry install`.
